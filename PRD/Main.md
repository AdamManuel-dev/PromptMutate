# Product Requirements Document: Prompt Mutation Testing System

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Product Name:** PromptMutate  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

PromptMutate is an intelligent system designed to automatically optimize prompts used by Autonomous Development Agents through mutation testing and deterministic scoring of generated code. The system will start with simple A/B testing capabilities and evolve into a sophisticated mutation-based optimization platform that explores the entire prompt solution space. By analyzing git repositories and the code they produce, PromptMutate will determine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies and continuously improve agent performance.

The system integrates with Claude Code initially, with extensibility for other AI agents through the existing task-kanban-mcp infrastructure. It provides deterministic scoring based on multiple code quality metrics, enabling reproducible evaluation and data-driven prompt optimization.

## 2. Problem Statement

Autonomous Development Agents rely on prompts that significantly impact code quality, yet there is no systematic way to evaluate and improve these prompts. Current challenges include:

- **Prompt Quality Variance**: Minor prompt changes can drastically affect output quality, but these effects are unpredictable
- **Lack of Objective Measurement**: No standardized way to measure prompt effectiveness beyond subjective assessment
- **Manual Optimization**: Prompt engineering remains a manual, time-consuming process
- **Limited Learning**: No mechanism to learn from past successes and failures systematically
- **Inconsistent Results**: Same prompts may produce varying quality outputs without clear understanding why

This results in:
- 40-60% variance in code quality from suboptimal prompts
- 10-20 hours per week spent on manual prompt refinement
- Missed opportunities for performance improvements
- Inconsistent agent behavior across projects

## 3. Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Automate Prompt Optimization**: Reduce manual prompt engineering effort by 80%
2. **Improve Code Quality**: Achieve 40-50% improvement in generated code quality scores
3. **Enable Continuous Learning**: Create a system that improves over time without human intervention
4. **Provide Deterministic Evaluation**: Ensure all scoring is reproducible and explainable

### Measurable Objectives
- Achieve 90% mutation score for generated test code within 6 months
- Reduce prompt optimization time from days to hours
- Maintain <100ms scoring latency for real-time feedback
- Process 1000+ code generation tasks daily
- Achieve 95% determinism in scoring (same input = same score)

### Success Criteria
- 25% improvement in Pass@1 rates for code generation tasks
- 85% reduction in API costs through efficient testing strategies
- Zero manual intervention required for continuous optimization
- Full integration with existing Claude Code workflows

### Quality Evaluation
6. **As a developer**, I want generated code to be evaluated on multiple quality metrics, so that we optimize for overall excellence, not just functionality.

7. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want mutation testing on generated tests, so that we ensure comprehensive test coverage beyond line metrics.

8. **As a developer**, I want to understand why certain prompts perform better, so that I can apply learnings to manual prompt creation.

### Integration & Workflow

10. **As a team lead**, I want to set quality thresholds and gates, so that only high-quality code reaches production.

11. **As a developer**, I want to override or rollback prompt changes, so that I maintain control when needed.

### Advanced Features
12. **As a developer**, I want the system to identify prompt patterns that work well for specific code types, so that we can create specialized prompts.

13. **As a team lead**, I want cost optimization through efficient testing strategies, so that we maximize value from our API budget.

14. **As a developer**, I want to export successful prompt patterns, so that we can share knowledge across teams.

    complexity: 0.15,
    performance: 0.15,
    security: 0.10,
    similarity: 0.05
  };
  
  // Normalize each metric to [0, 1]
  const normalized = normalizeMetrics(metrics);
  
  // Calculate weighted sum
  let score = 0;
  for (const [metric, weight] of Object.entries(weights)) {
    score += normalized[metric] * weight;
  }
  
  return score;
}

// Mutation Score Formula
mutationScore = killedMutants / (totalMutants - equivalentMutants);
```

### B. Example Prompt Mutations

**Original Prompt**:
```
Create a React component for user authentication with email and password fields.
```

**Token-Level Mutation**:
```
Develop a React component for user authentication with email and password inputs.
```

**Structure-Level Mutation**:
```
Create a React component with the following requirements:
- User authentication functionality
